        "This task focuses on the comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomes from different species, primarily birds, mammals, and insects. The aim is to understand the evolutionary relationships between these species by analyzing and comparing their mitochondrial DNA, which is about 16,000 base pairs in length. You will use advanced computational methods to construct phylogenetic trees and delve into the ecological and anthropological insights that can be gleaned from this data. This project is designed to provide a comprehensive understanding of mitochondrial genomics, its importance in evolutionary biology, and its applications in broader scientific contexts.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Bayesian Inference Trees**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: This method uses Bayesian statistics to estimate the likelihood of different evolutionary histories. It's particularly useful for its ability to estimate branch lengths and support values.\n",
        "    - **Tools**: MrBayes, BEAST\n",
        "        - MrBayes ([Official Website](https://nbisweden.github.io/MrBayes/manual.html/)) is widely recognized for its robustness in Bayesian inference.\n",

        "2. **Maximum Likelihood Trees**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: Maximum Likelihood methods evaluate tree topologies based on the likelihood of observed data given a tree model. It's known for its statistical rigor and accuracy.\n",
        "    - **Tools**: RAxML, PhyML\n",
        "        - RAxML ([RAxML GitHub](https://github.com/stamatak/standard-RAxML)) is preferred for large datasets due to its efficiency.\n",
        "        - PhyML ([PhyML Documentation](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/)) offers a balance of speed and accuracy, with a user-friendly interface.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Neighbor-Joining Trees**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: The Neighbor-Joining method is a distance-based approach that constructs phylogenetic trees by evaluating the genetic distance between sequences. It is known for its speed and simplicity, making it well-suited for initial exploratory analyses.\n",

        "1. **FigTree**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: FigTree is designed for the graphical representation of phylogenetic trees. It's excellent for creating publication-ready visualizations.\n",
        "    - **Resource**: [FigTree Tool](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/)\n",
        "    - **Usage**: Use FigTree to add detailed annotations, adjust branch colors, and format tree layouts for clear, interpretable visualizations.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **iTOL (Interactive Tree Of Life)**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: iTOL is a web-based tool for the display, annotation, and management of phylogenetic trees, offering extensive customization options.\n",
        "    - **Resource**: [iTOL Website](https://itol.embl.de/)\n",
        "    - **Usage**: Ideal for interactive tree visualizations. It allows users to explore different layers of data through their tree, such as adding charts or color-coding branches.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Dendroscope**:\n",
        "    - **Overview**: Dendroscope is a software program for viewing and editing phylogenetic trees, particularly useful for large datasets.\n",

        "#### Task:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Visualize Each Tree**: Use one or more of the above tools to visualize the phylogenetic trees you constructed using Bayesian inference, maximum likelihood, and neighbor-joining methods.\n",
        "- **Highlight Differences**: Focus on highlighting the differences and similarities between the trees obtained from the different methods. Pay attention to tree topology, branch lengths, and any notable patterns.\n",
        "- **Interpretation and Presentation**: Aim for visualizations that are not only accurate but also interpretable and visually appealing. This will enhance the clarity of your work."
